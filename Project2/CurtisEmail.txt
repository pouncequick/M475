Hello/Greetings/Salutations

Body:

Dr. Curtis;

I heard my dad came and spoke with you and found out that you were considering me as an 
intern. I am very grateful for the honor you do me by offering to include me in your group.

I am very interested in 


AJ's idea

Dr. Curtis;

My name is Nicole Nutter, a graduating senior in AE. I am interested in computational fluid
dynamics. My father, Greg Nutter, told me that you might be interested in meeting with me to 
talk about some of your work. If this is the case, I would be happy to do so.

I am available to meet at [times]. I currently work at the MDF, so I can meet at ORNL's main
campus or somewhere in between if you prefer.

Thank you, 
Nicole
